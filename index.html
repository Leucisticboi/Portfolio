            <p id="about-me">Welcome to my portfolio page!<br>My name is Robert, but I go by Milo. I am from a large family of intellectuals in Leonardtown, MD.
            I currently have two dogs named Spike and Alice. I enjoy taking them on hikes in the Rocky Mountains during the summer, and during the winter we stay warm by visiting California.<br>
            I have a wide range of hobbies and interests including reading, camping, snowboarding, leatherwork, crypto trading, video games, and many more. I am currently learning full-stack web development through the University of Utah's online coding bootcamp.</p>
